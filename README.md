# Pozify

Pozify is a small-model workout form coach for people who want to train at home but still need clear,
trustworthy feedback. A user uploads a short exercise video, adds basic training context, and gets a
structured form-review report with rep counts, movement notes, annotated video, and a grounded coach
summary.

Pozify is built for users who avoid gyms because they are far away, too crowded, intimidating, or too
expensive to replace with a private trainer. It gives them a second set of eyes without pretending to
be a clinician or a full personal coach.

Pozify is not a medical device. It does not diagnose injuries, claim injury prevention, or replace a
qualified trainer, clinician, or physical therapist.

## What Pozify Delivers

For each uploaded workout clip, Pozify produces:

- detected exercise and confidence
- rep-by-rep analysis
- valid variation markers versus real form issues
- annotated output video and issue clips
- grounded coach summary with fixes and a next-session plan
- verifier-backed confidence and safety notes

The supported exercise labels are `squat`, `push_up`, `shoulder_press`, and `unknown`. The `unknown`
label is intentional: Pozify should reject unsupported or unclear clips instead of forcing every
video into one of the supported movements.

## Product Flow

Pozify is not a generic chatbot and not a vague video captioner. It is a grounded movement-analysis
pipeline:

```text
video + user profile
-> video QC
-> pose extraction
-> pose cleaning
-> exercise router
-> exercise-specific rep counter
-> per-rep analysis
-> variation detection
-> issue markers
-> annotated video renderer
-> grounded coach summary
-> verifier
-> final report
```

The main product decision is simple: structured evidence first, language second. The language model
does not inspect the raw video directly and invent advice. It explains the structured findings that
the pipeline has already produced.

## Small-Model Strategy

Pozify is built around the belief that small, task-specific models can be the right default for many
real products. A small model does not need to act like a large general assistant if the product gives
it a narrow job, clean inputs, and a verifier.

That is the strategy here:

- use pose and deterministic logic to extract evidence before generation
- train small models on the exact task they must perform
- keep each model boundary inspectable
- retrieve exercise-specific knowledge cards instead of relying on generic memory
- evaluate outputs against product contracts, not only fluency
- fall back conservatively when model output is unavailable or ungrounded

For narrow tasks such as exercise routing or structured JSON-to-coaching-summary generation, a
fine-tuned small model can match or beat a much larger generic model on the product's actual quality
bar. The advantage comes from being optimized for the exact schema, vocabulary, examples, and failure
modes Pozify cares about.

## Models We Use

Every runtime model used by Pozify fits under the Build Small `32B` parameter cap.

| Component                   | Model or method                                  | Role                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pose extraction             | MediaPipe Pose Landmarker Lite                   | Extracts body landmarks from video frames.                            |
| Exercise router             | Custom PyTorch BiLSTM over 30-frame pose windows | Classifies `squat`, `push_up`, `shoulder_press`, or `unknown`.        |
| Router baseline             | scikit-learn `HistGradientBoostingClassifier`    | Reference and fallback artifact for router experiments.               |
| Rep counting                | Exercise-specific state machines                 | Counts reps from movement signals without an LLM.                     |
| Issue markers               | Transparent rules over per-rep metrics           | Separates valid variations from likely form issues.                   |
| Coach-summary base          | `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-4B-BF16`          | Base model for coach-summary LoRA SFT.                                |
| Coach summary               | `build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1`    | Fine-tuned model for grounded structured coaching output.             |
| Local/off-grid summary path | Nemotron GGUF through `llama.cpp`                | Optional local runtime path for small-model inference.                |
| Verifier                    | Deterministic grounding and safety checks        | Blocks unsupported issues, diagnosis language, and ungrounded claims. |

The trained exercise router is intentionally tiny:

| Artifact                        |     Count |
| ------------------------------- | --------: |
| BiLSTM router trainable params  |   182,796 |
| Router input features per frame |       237 |
| Window length                   | 30 frames |
| Output classes                  |         4 |

## Why It Fits Build Small

Pozify matches `Backyard AI` because it solves an everyday problem with a personal, practical tool:
affordable at-home workout feedback without needing a gym or private coach.

It also matches the broader Build Small philosophy:

- local-first and modular architecture
- transparent model boundaries instead of one giant opaque model
- per-component models under the `32B` limit
- task-specific fine-tuning instead of relying only on a large general model
- useful day-to-day workflow, not only a technical demo

- `Hugging Face Inference` and local runtimes for small-model inference
- `Modal` for training, evaluation, merging, and publishing workflows
- `OpenAI Codex` for implementation support and iteration speed

## How We Used Codex

We used OpenAI Codex as a repo-aware coding agent during the build. The useful pattern was not to
ask for generic code, but to ask Codex to inspect the current project, propose the smallest useful
change, edit the right files, run relevant checks, and summarize what changed.

Codex was most helpful for:

- turning product ideas into scoped engineering tasks
- moving across Python pipeline code, web UI files, scripts, configs, tests, and docs
- researching changing platform constraints and connecting them back to this repo
- reviewing diffs for regressions, missing tests, grounding problems, and unsafe wording
- keeping hackathon notes, training reports, and handoff docs in sync with implementation

The detailed team note is in [docs/50-codex-development-workflow.md](docs/50-codex-development-workflow.md).
