# Pozify

Pozify is a small-model workout form coach for people who want to train at home but still need
clear, trustworthy feedback. It is built for users who avoid gyms because they are far away, too
crowded, intimidating, or too expensive to replace with a 1:1 personal trainer.

Upload a short workout video and Pozify turns it into a structured, grounded form-review report:

- exercise detected
- reps counted
- variation and issue markers
- annotated video and clips
- grounded coach summary
- verifier-backed confidence and safety notes

The app is built as a small-model pipeline, not a giant end-to-end model. It combines transparent
pose analysis, a trained exercise router, exercise-specific rule logic, deterministic knowledge-card
retrieval, and a small summary model.

Pozify is not a medical device. It does not diagnose injuries, claim injury prevention, or replace a
qualified trainer, clinician, or physical therapist.

## Hackathon Snapshot

- Track: `Backyard AI`
- Core user impact: affordable at-home workout feedback without needing a gym or private coach
- Submission format: `Gradio Space`
- Build Small fit: every runtime model used by Pozify is under the `32B` cap
- Demo video: `ADD_PUBLIC_DEMO_LINK`
- Social post: `ADD_PUBLIC_SOCIAL_POST_LINK`
- Hugging Face Space: [build-small-hackathon/Pozify](https://huggingface.co/spaces/build-small-hackathon/Pozify)
- Team repo: [tihado/Pozify](https://github.com/tihado/Pozify)
- Default coach-summary model: `build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1`

## The Problem

Most beginner and intermediate gym users do not need a full-time trainer. They need a fast second
set of eyes:

- "Am I doing the right exercise?"
- "How many clean reps did I actually complete?"
- "Is this a valid variation or a real issue?"
- "What should I fix next session?"

Today, that feedback is often inaccessible:

- gyms can be far away or inconvenient
- crowded spaces make people self-conscious about training in public
- many users are afraid of doing an exercise wrong and being judged
- private coaching is effective, but too expensive for regular use

Pozify makes that feedback accessible from a short video, with a pipeline users can inspect instead
of a black-box answer they just have to trust.

## Why It Stands Out

Pozify is not a generic chatbot and not a vague video captioner. It is a grounded movement-analysis
pipeline:

- computer vision extracts pose landmarks
- a tiny trained router identifies the exercise
- deterministic logic counts reps and tracks issues
- knowledge cards keep the coaching language exercise-specific
- a small language model turns structured JSON into a coach summary
- a verifier catches unsafe or ungrounded summary output

That design is the core product difference: structured evidence first, language second.

## Sponsor Stack

Primary sponsor tools used in this build:

- `Hugging Face Spaces` for the app surface
- `Hugging Face Inference` for cloud small-model runtime
- `Modal` for coach-summary training and publishing workflows
- `OpenAI Codex` for implementation support and hackathon build velocity

Sponsor-fit highlights:

- `Modal`: used to prepare data, train, evaluate, merge, and publish the coach-summary model
- `OpenAI Codex`: used as the coding copilot during implementation and iteration
- `Hugging Face`: used across the product surface, cloud inference path, model hosting, and Space deployment

## Why Pozify Fits Build Small

Pozify matches `Backyard AI` because it solves a real everyday problem with a small, practical,
personal tool. It also strongly matches the broader Build Small philosophy:

- local-first and modular architecture
- transparent model boundaries instead of one giant opaque system
- per-component models all under the `32B` limit
- useful enough for repeated day-to-day use, not just a tech demo

This gives Pozify a practical consumer use case that still feels very "Build Small": local-first,
inspectable, modular, and cheap enough to run on real-world hardware budgets.

## What Pozify Delivers

For each uploaded workout clip, Pozify produces:

- detected exercise and confidence
- rep-by-rep analysis JSON
- valid variation markers versus real issues
- annotated output video
- grounded coach summary with fixes and next-session plan
- provider, model, and summary source metadata in the UI

The UI also makes it obvious whether the coach summary came from:

- `hf_inference`
- a local merged model
- or a conservative fallback

## Model Stack

| Component               | Model or method                                          | Trained here?           | Runtime                                        |

## Run The App Locally

This repo uses a `src/` layout, but `uv` is configured with `package = false`. Run it with:

```bash
uv sync
uv run python app.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.

### Mock vs Real Mode

By default:

- if no video is provided, Pozify uses mock mode
- if a real video is uploaded, Pozify runs the full analysis pipeline

Force mock mode:

```bash
POZIFY_MOCK_MODE=1 uv run python app.py
```

Force real mode:

```bash
POZIFY_MOCK_MODE=0 uv run python app.py
```

If you already have the MediaPipe task file locally:

```bash
POZIFY_MEDIAPIPE_POSE_MODEL=/path/to/pose_landmarker_lite.task \
POZIFY_MOCK_MODE=0 \
uv run python app.py
```

## Coach Summary Runtime Options

### 1. Fine-tuned coach model

The app defaults to the fine-tuned coach-summary model:

```bash
export POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_MODEL=build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1
uv run python app.py
```

Pozify tries `chat_completion` first and falls back to `text_generation` when Hugging Face reports
that the repo is not a chat model. The deterministic fallback summary remains enabled if hosted
inference is unavailable or the model output fails validation.

Recommended if you want the live Space or local demo to behave predictably during judging.

For regular Hugging Face Spaces, keep the provider on hosted inference unless you have a dedicated
local model runtime:

```bash
POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_PROVIDER=hf_inference
POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_MODEL=build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1
```

For Hugging Face ZeroGPU Spaces, local Transformers is selected automatically so the app does not
call the hosted Hugging Face Inference API. You can also set it explicitly:

```bash
POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_PROVIDER=local_transformers
POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_MODEL=nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-4B-BF16
POZIFY_SPACES_GPU_DURATION=300
```

`HF_TOKEN` is only needed for `hf_inference` or for downloading a private/gated local model repo.
Pozify uses the Nemotron implementation bundled with Transformers instead of downloading remote
model code. If fast Mamba kernels are unavailable at runtime, Pozify caps the local prompt context
before generation to avoid the slow naive Mamba path crashing CUDA.

### 2. Use the fine-tuned merged model locally

Download the merged repo locally, then point Pozify at it:

```bash
export POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_LOCAL_MODEL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/merged_model
export POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_BASE_MODEL=nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-4B-BF16
export POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_ADAPTER_ID=build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1
uv run python app.py
```

This is the simplest way to use `build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1` today without adding a
dedicated inference endpoint.

### 3. Base cloud model override

If you need the Nemotron base-model runtime:

```bash
export POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_MODEL=nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-4B-BF16
uv run python app.py
```

### 4. llama.cpp

Pozify can send the coach-summary prompt to a local `llama-server` that exposes the
OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint.

Example:

```bash
llama-server \
  --model /path/to/nemotron-3-nano-4b.gguf \
  --ctx-size 4096 \
  --n-gpu-layers 99 \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080
```

Then:

```bash
POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_PROVIDER=llama_cpp \
POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_MODEL=local-nemotron-3-nano-4b-gguf \
POZIFY_LLAMA_CPP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS=700 \
uv run python app.py
```

### Useful environment variables

| Variable                                    | Purpose                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POZIFY_ROUTER_DEVICE`                      | Override router device, for example `cpu` or `cuda`.              |
| `POZIFY_SPACES_GPU_DURATION`                | `spaces.GPU` duration in seconds, default `120`.                  |
| `POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_PROVIDER`             | `hf_inference`, `local_transformers`, or `llama_cpp`.             |
| `POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_MODEL`                | Coach model id or llama.cpp model alias.                          |
| `POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_LOCAL_MODEL_DIR`      | Prefer a local merged/model directory for coach summary.          |
| `POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_MAX_INPUT_TOKENS`     | Max local Transformers prompt tokens, default `2048`.             |
| `POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_BYPASS_VERIFIER`      | Keep model output even when verifier fails.                       |

## Exercise Router Training

Run the full router training and publish flow:

```bash
uv run modal run scripts/exercise_router_modal.py \
  --stage all \
  --repo-id build-small-hackathon/pozify-exercise-router
```

Step-by-step:

```bash
uv run modal run scripts/exercise_router_modal.py --stage ingest
uv run modal run scripts/exercise_router_modal.py --stage features
uv run modal run scripts/exercise_router_modal.py --stage train-baseline
uv run modal run scripts/exercise_router_modal.py --stage train-temporal
uv run modal run scripts/exercise_router_modal.py --stage evaluate
uv run modal run scripts/exercise_router_modal.py --stage publish --repo-id build-small-hackathon/pozify-exercise-router
```

The active router artifact is `temporal.pt`; the baseline is retained for comparison and fallback.

## Coach Summary Training

Build the grounded SFT dataset:

```bash
uv run python scripts/build_coach_summary_sft_dataset.py
```

Run the full coach-summary Modal flow:

```bash
uv run modal run scripts/coach_summary_modal.py \
  --stage all \
  --epochs 2 \
  --style-weight 0.2 \
  --repo-id build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1
```

The checked-in fine-tune config uses `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-4B-BF16` as the base model.
The Modal training, evaluation, and merge stages request an `A100-80GB` GPU because the Nemotron
base model can run out of CUDA memory on the previous `A10G` setting.

Step-by-step:

```bash
uv run modal run scripts/coach_summary_modal.py --stage prepare-data
uv run modal run scripts/coach_summary_modal.py --stage train --epochs 2 --style-weight 0.2
uv run modal run scripts/coach_summary_modal.py --stage evaluate --limit 5
uv run modal run scripts/coach_summary_modal.py --stage merge
uv run modal run scripts/coach_summary_modal.py --stage publish-merged --repo-id build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1
```

Important runtime note:

- the default coach model is `build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1`
- Hugging Face hosted inference may still reject a repo or produce invalid JSON, so the
  conservative fallback summary stays enabled
- for the most predictable fine-tuned inference path, use `POZIFY_COACH_SUMMARY_LOCAL_MODEL_DIR`

## Generated Artifacts

Each run creates `runs/<run_id>/` with:

- `manifest.json`
- `user_profile.json`
- `video_manifest.json`
- `pose_sequence.json`
- `exercise_classification.json`
- `reps.json`
- `rep_debug.json`
- `rep_analysis.json`
- `variation.json`
- `issue_markers.json`
- `annotated_video.mp4`
- `coach_summary.json`
- `verification.json`
- `final_report.json`

JSON artifacts are validated before they are written. The final report records:

- analysis mode
- pose source
- knowledge-card provenance
- coach summary provider/model/source
- verifier status and bypass flags

[docs/01-docs-index.md](docs/01-docs-index.md).

## Development Checks

```bash
uv run ruff check
uv run python -m compileall src scripts tests app.py
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

Run the real MediaPipe fixture smoke test only when the fixture is available:

```bash
POZIFY_RUN_REAL_POSE_TESTS=1 \
uv run python -m unittest tests.test_pose_steps.PoseStepTests.test_real_sample_mov_extracts_pose_landmarks
```
