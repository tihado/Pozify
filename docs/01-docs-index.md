## Presentation / Demo

## Team Process

## Notes

- Current coach-summary runtime default: `build-small-hackathon/pozify-coach-summary1`
- The Hugging Face provider tries `chat_completion` first, then `text_generation` for non-chat
  model repos; local merged-model inference remains the most predictable fine-tuned path
- Current app entrypoint and runtime options are documented in [02-technical-setup.md](02-technical-setup.md)
